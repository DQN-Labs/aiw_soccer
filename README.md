# aiw_soccer
Soccer game for AI Warehouse https://www.youtube.com/@aiwarehouse, made by the community, for the community.

You play against albert and, in case you don't know what soccer is, you kick the ball into the opponents goal. In the game there's a bunch of different characters, including: Albert, Kai, [redacted], and more. There's also a bunch of Easter eggs and codes, to make the game a little bit more interesting. 

Have fun!
